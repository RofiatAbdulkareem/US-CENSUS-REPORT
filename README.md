# US-CENSUS-REPORT

In this analysis, I explore key insights from the US Census data Using PowerBI, focusing on population, employment distribution, poverty rates, unemployment rates and many more across states. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of these crucial socio-economic factors, allowing us to gain a better understanding of the United States' demographic and economic landscape. 

The following are my Insights:

1.  Across all 52 states, whites are the most dominated race, a larger percentage of the total population are private workers and mostly work in the office.

2.  Women and Men diverged the most in New York, 589K higher than men 

3.  Texas had the highest sum of unemployment and also the highest sum of poverty, the correlation between unemployment and poverty rate is 0.97; there might be a causal effect between this two and a remedy in one 
  could be beneficial to the other.

4.  California had the highest population and the highest employment rate.

5.  Average amount of money earned per state (income per capital) is highest in district of Columbia and when compared to the total number of employed, had a negative correlation; it means Employment is not the 
  reason for the high IncomePerCap.
